	How to register a new CommandClass

//CommandClasses are available functions that can be bint to keys by the user.
//It's very useful to create a "Debug" key when developing for YR.

//First, create a new CommandClass, here's an example:
class MyCommandClass : public CommandClass
{
public:
	//Destructor
	virtual ~MyCommandClass(){}

	//CommandClass
	virtual const char*			GetName()
	{
		return "MyCommand";		//Possibly the name for uimd.ini?
	}
	
	virtual const wchar_t*		GetUIName()
	{
		return L"My Command";	//Display name
	}
	
	virtual const wchar_t*		GetUICategory()
	{
		return L"My DLL";		//The command Categroy
								//If it doesn't exit yet, it will be created
	}
	
	virtual const wchar_t*		GetUIDescription()
	{
		return L"Does cool stuff.";	//The Description
	}
	
	virtual void			Execute(DWORD dwUnk)
	{
		//This will be called when the command gets executed.
	}

	//Constructor
	CommandClass(){}
};

//To register your new command class, simply contruct it *ONCE* and place it in the global array:
	CommandClass::Array->AddItem(new MyCommandClass());
	
//The best place to construct it at is in the CommandClassCallback::Register callback.
